        //         Control Flow is the order in which statements are executed in a program.

        // By default, JavaScript runs code from top to bottom and left to right.

        // Control flow statements let you change that order, based on conditions, loops or keywords.
        // Default flow executes code sequentially(from top to bottom / from left to right).
        //         JavaScript runs on a single thread.
        // It can only do one thing at a time.
        // Every task has to wait for the previous one to finish.
        // This can freeze an application during slow operations(like file requests).
        //         JavaScript Asynchronous Flow refers to how JavaScript handles tasks that take time to complete, like reading files, or waiting for user input, without blocking the execution of other code.
        // To prevent blocking, JavaScript can use asynchronous programming.
        // This allows certain operations to run in the background, and their results are handled later, when they are ready.
        // Asynchronus Patterns
        //     Events
        //     Callbacks
        //     Promises
        //     Async / Await
