1. Explain JavaScript and its role in web development

JavaScript is a programming language used to make websites interactive.
It adds behavior like clicks, form validation, animations, and dynamic content.

2. Difference between var, let, and const

var → function-scoped, can be redeclared
let → block-scoped, can be reassigned
const → block-scoped, cannot be reassigned

3. Explain data types in JavaScript

JavaScript data types define what kind of data is stored.
Examples: string, number, boolean, undefined, null, object.

4. Explain operators in JavaScript

Operators are symbols used to perform operations.
Examples: +, -, *, /, =, ==, ===.

5. Explain conditional statements

Conditional statements execute code based on conditions.
Examples: if, else, else if.

6. Explain loops with examples

Loops repeat code until a condition is false.
Examples: for, while, do-while.

7. Explain arrays and common methods

Arrays store multiple values in one variable.
push() → Adds element to the end of array
pop() → Removes last element
shift() → Removes first element
unshift() → Adds element at the beginning
map() → Creates new array by modifying elements
filter() → Creates new array based on condition
reduce() → Reduces array to a single value
forEach() → Executes function for each element
find() → Returns first matching element
includes() → Checks if value exists
slice() → Extracts part of array
splice() → Adds/removes elements in array

8. Explain objects in JavaScript

Objects store data in key–value pairs.
Used to represent real-world entities.

9. Difference between primitive and non-primitive types

Primitive → stores single value (number, string)
Non-primitive → stores multiple values (array, object)

10. Explain functions and parameters

Functions are reusable blocks of code.
Parameters are values passed into functions.

11. Explain string methods
String methods are used to modify, search, and manipulate text.
Examples: 
length → Returns number of characters
toUpperCase() → Converts text to uppercase
toLowerCase() → Converts text to lowercase
trim() → Removes extra spaces
slice() → Extracts part of a string
substring() → Extracts characters between indexes
replace() → Replaces text with new text
replaceAll() → Replaces all matching text
includes() → Checks if text exists
charAt() → Returns character at position
split() → Converts string into array

12. Explain Math object
The Math object is used to perform mathematical operations in JavaScript.
Math.random() → Returns a random number between 0 and 1
Math.round() → Rounds a number to nearest integer
Math.floor() → Rounds down to nearest integer
Math.ceil() → Rounds up to nearest integer
Math.sqrt() → Returns square root
Math.pow() → Returns power of a number
Math.max() → Returns highest value
Math.min() → Returns lowest value

Used to get current date, time, year, etc.
13. Explain Date Object (Methods + Short Explanation)

13. Explain Date object
The Date object is used to work with date and time in JavaScript.
new Date() → Creates current date and time
getDate() → Returns day of the month
getMonth() → Returns month (0–11)
getFullYear() → Returns year
getHours() → Returns hours
getMinutes() → Returns minutes
getSeconds() → Returns seconds
getTime() → Returns time in milliseconds

14. Explain type conversion

Type conversion changes one data type to another.
Example: Number("10"), String(100).
Number() → Converts to number
String() → Converts to string
Boolean() → Converts to true or false
parseInt() → Converts string to integer
parseFloat() → Converts string to decimal number

15. Explain comparison operators

Comparison operators compare values.
Examples:
== → Equal (checks value only)
=== → Strict equal (checks value and type)
!= → Not equal
!== → Strict not equal
> → Greater than
< → Less than
>= → Greater than or equal
<= → Less than or equal

16. Explain logical operators

Logical operators combine conditions and control decision making.
Examples:
&& (AND) → True if both conditions are true
|| (OR) → True if any one condition is true
! (NOT) → Reverses the condition

17. Explain error handling using try-catch
try-catch handles runtime errors without stopping the program.

18. Explain switch statement

switch checks one value against many cases.
Used instead of multiple if-else.

19. Explain nested loops

Nested loops are loops inside another loop.
Used for patterns and multi-dimensional data.

20. Explain array iteration techniques

Array iteration techniques are used to loop through array elements and perform operations on each item.

forEach() → Executes a function for each element (no new array)
map() → Iterates and returns a new array
for...of → Loops through array values one by one
for loop → Traditional looping using index

21. Explain object methods

Object methods are functions inside objects.
They perform actions using object data.

22. Explain basic DOM concept

DOM represents the HTML page as objects.
JavaScript uses DOM to change HTML and CSS.

23. Explain events in JavaScript

Events in JavaScript are actions that occur due to user interaction or browser activity.
Examples: 
click → When user clicks an element
submit → When form is submitted
mouseover → When mouse moves over an element
keydown → When a key is pressed
load → When page finishes loading
